# Usage
The management of the home server encompasses setting up and configuring applications, along with handling containers.

First steps typically involves adding new applications. In [Adding applications](/usage/add-new-app), you'll find an outline of the file and directory structure, as well as recommended content for `docker-compose.yml` files defining services.

Additionally, [Set up ENV](/usage/set-up-env) provides further details on managing environment variables across home server applications.

Lastly, [Manage containers](/usage/manage-containers) offers a brief overview of working with the Docker containers.
