# Host

The *host* is the base for the home server. While it can be both a [VPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server) or a physical machine, it is ideally a Linux machine and we need full shell access for setting up the server.

Certainly nothing speaks against [Debian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian) as a choice of operating system; personally I favor [Fedora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_Linux). The more detailed setup steps outlined later should be equally applicable to both or even other distributions.

Having a freshly installed host system up and running, we can proceed with setting it up to our needs in [Setting up host](/host/setting-up-host).

Also included in the guide is handling [Maintenance](/host/maintenance) tasks such as regular backups to ensure smooth operation over longer periods.
