# About
I'm [FjellOverflow](https://fjelloverflow.dev/), a developer interested in self-hosted solutions and privacy.

Over time, I've built and maintained my own home server, called it *Fjellheimen*, and accumulated loads of configs, scripts and notes. While tracking all this with Git, the setup still became rather complex to manage and keep track of.

While the server runs smoothly without issues for long periods of time, it used to be challenging to come back and start modifying or migrating parts of the setup and so I decided to create this documention.

Hence, this documentation serves both as a reminder and living document to help my future self 
as well as any other interested people that need guidance or inspiration on how to start their own homeserver setup!
