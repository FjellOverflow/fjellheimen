# Overview

The docs are split up in a few larger topics.

The [Resources](/introduction/resources) page lists links to other potentially useful materials regarding self-hosting and home server administration.

The [Host](/host/overview) section covers aspects regarding the physical home server machine, including [initial installations](/host/setting-up-host) and [maintenance tasks](/host/maintenance).

The [Usage](/applications/overview) section guides the process of [adding a new application](/applications/add-new-app) or stack into the system, configuring [environment variables](/applications/set-up-env) with sensitive data, and [managing Docker containers](/applications/manage-containers).

The [Stacks](/stacks/overview) section lists all included applications and provides additional information on configurations and interactions. It servers as the go-to resource to understand specific applications purposes, and see examples of Docker setups.
